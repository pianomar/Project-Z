# Project-Z
This was the final assignment of a ReactNative course I did with CoderHouse.

It is a very simplified clone of instagram where you can:
- Login.
- Add and remove images from camera or from the gallery.
- See other user's images.

Coming from developing native Android it was a very interesting experience that I thouroughly enjoyed.
